RECREATING QUIZKI'S DEV WORKSPACE
-----------------------------------
Starting from scratch.

-- be sure all branches of the git repo and the local repo are synced.
-- mvn clean packge, to be sure all code is building, tests are passing
-- copy_quizki_war_to_tomcat.sh
-- start tomcat
-- you can hit localhost:8080 in a browser if you like, but most likely quizki is running.
-- In Eclipse, in a clean workspace, import Git Project at: /home/jjames/haxSVN/trunk/projects/questions/src/quizki-tomcat-git
--  Run > Debug Configurations > Remote Java Application. Create a new one, name it quizki_tomcat, hit apply and debug.

You should be good to go now!
