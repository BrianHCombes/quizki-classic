RECREATING QUIZKI'S DEV WORKSPACE
-----------------------------------
Starting from scratch.

-- be sure all branches of the git repo and the local repo are synced.
-- be sure the quizki database exists. To be sure, you can just run 'mysql -u quizki -p < ./src/main/resources/META-INF/sql/mysql/populate_database_quizkiDotCom_20141214.sql'
-- be sure that the file $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh is readable, and contains the line 'JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -DQUIZKI_JDBC_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/quizki_db -DSHIRO_SERVER_NAME=localhost"' (change localhost to the appropriate server as necessary
-- mvn clean packge, to be sure all code is building, tests are passing
-- copy_quizki_war_to_tomcat.sh
-- start tomcat
-- you can hit localhost:8080 in a browser if you like, but most likely quizki is running.
-- In Eclipse, in a clean workspace, import Git Project at: /home/jjames/haxSVN/trunk/projects/questions/src/quizki-tomcat-git
--  Run > Debug Configurations > Remote Java Application. Create a new one, name it quizki_tomcat, hit apply and debug.

You should be good to go now!
