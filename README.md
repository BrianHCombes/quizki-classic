# ![QUIZKI](./src/main/webapp/images/logo-light.png) **Under construction readme later**

A web application to help students of all stripes master their subject matter with questions and answers they create, which are then shared with and validated by other students who are studying the same topics. The interface (will) allow the creation of any question, including, but certainly not limited to, flashcards.

Go ahead, experiece [quizki](http://www.quizki.com) live! Afterward take time to read [about quizki](./ABOUT) for a general understanding of how the system works before getting started as a developer or tester.

## Getting Started

The following paragraphs explain how to get a copy of quizki up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

See the Deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Listed below are the software products you will need resident on your local machine. 

For each of the software products listed below, install the most recent generally available (GA) version. If you live on the edge, feel free to use the latest Alpha or Beta versions. Yet, if you are fairly new to programing, Alpha and Beta versions may contain problematic errors making it difficult to determine if your code or the software you are using is causing an anomaly. Thus, stay with the latest GA version to reduce complexity, as you learn to code.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used for version control
- [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) - server used to run backend application
- [MySQL Community Edition (GPL)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) - database used with quizki
- [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) - used to build the quizki initially and after code changes
- browsers - [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome/), [Mozilla Foxfire](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Microsoft Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/ie/) or other browsers
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) - Eclipse is recommended. Yet, any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provided it supports Java with Maven builds.

### Installing

Installion of the tools listed above will vary slightly based upon the operating system you are using. To get started select the appropriate developer's file for the operating system on your local machine from the list provided below.


- [Unix or Lnix](./developer)
- [Windows](./DEVELOPER_WINDOWS.txt)
- [iOS]() -- Oh my, ask Mr J!
- [Other]() -- Rats, ask Mr J!

 
Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## quizki Architecture

This is a new section not in the template. It was added because we need an overview of the archtecture.

### Frontend
Describe the frontend environment

### Backend
Describe the backend environment

### Database

### Odds and Ends
Catch all for residuals


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
