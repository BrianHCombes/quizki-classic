From JimD for testing setup on the Mac

For our present and future Mac developers here is a good post on how the Mac handles java native and dynamic libraries. Run the code below to find out what your library path is set to. I tried to `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on my system but there was no response (or for `sudo echo...`). Apple has it’s own version of java, Apple Java and installation and library handling is integrated into the OS presumably for security purposes but more likely to disorient developers! :slightly_smiling_face:
Note: I am not using Apple Java, you can use the latest Java by downloading an installer from Oracle and running it, but it leaves Apple Java on the system.

added this Plain Text snippet: Get library path for Mac 



import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class LibraryPath {

	public static String getPath() {
	
		String property = System.getProperty("java.library.path");
		String path = "";
		StringTokenizer parser = new StringTokenizer(property, ":", true);
		
		while (parser.hasMoreTokens()) {
			
			path += parser.nextToken();
		}
		return path;
	}	
}
rename the paths and copy to your script directory. Type deployQuizki.sh to reload the latest WAR file.

Added and commented on this Plain Text snippet: Quizki Deployment Script For Mac 

#! /bin/bash


# replace this path with the path to your Tomcat install if differernt

cd /Library/Tomcat/bin
./shutdown.sh


# Replace this path with the path to your Tomcat webapps directory

cd /usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.6/webapps


# Replace this path with the path to your Target file


cp ~/eclipse-workspace/quizki2/target/quizki-1.3.war ROOT.war


# same path as line 4


cd /Library/Tomcat/bin


# This will start Tomcat in Production mode


# ./startup.sh


# This will start it in Debug mode on the default port 8000

./catalina.sh "jpda" "start"

Java running on MacOS 10.13 expects native code and dynamic libraries to be located in `/Users/your_user_name/Library/Java/Extensions` to get the debugger running you need to copy the file `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/libjwdp.dylib` to this directory AND change the owner of the copy to `your_user_name:your_group`. You can find other library paths by running the previous code snippet. Any of these paths will work for the dynamic library locations. This applies to all `.dynlib` files so 
moving them all over to the library path and and changing the ownership will prevent problems.

The command `./catalina.sh jpda start` will start Tomcat in debug mode and the command `./shutdown.sh` will stop it. The command `./startup.sh` will start it in production mode (no debugger). Using this method NO changes are needed in `setenv.sh`.
