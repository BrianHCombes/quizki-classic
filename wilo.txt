Where I Left Off
----------------

In the take exam UI, I need radio switch and checkbox functionality to work as appropriate.. To that end, I'd created the TakeExamChoiceItemFactory.getFinalizeViewCollectionFunction()
to provide a question type appropriate function to set whatever attributes are necessary. But I don't think its working, and I don't really
understand the .bootstrapSwitch function.. so I need to study that, understand what its doing. It previously was working, at least from a UI if not functionality perspective, by
just calling bootstrapSwitch(), but now, using the example for radio buttons from the bootstrapswitch website, its not working.. and that example doesn't use the empty parameter call
to bootstrapSwitch(). But i was, and it was working.. why is that? so i need to understand the bootstrapSwitch() function.

in short, I left off just about to review the source for bootstrapSwitch() in bootstrap-switch.js. Also, I updated the JavaScript Development Tools in Eclipse. Not sure I'm making the
best use of that.

also, its workin in create question.. so chceck there.

so, I had been trying to get radio button behavior working in Take Exam.. presently it works like a checkbox, each field being independent of
the other.. but that turned out to be more difficult than I thought, probably involving an upgrade of bootstrap-switch and flatUI to make that
happen. And thats just too much to do now. So I reverted those changes, and moved on to Generate Exam.

I read my notes on the 2TB drive about Generate Exam, and got the image from elance.. the views for generate exam are not populating yet, and
I next need to complete them, and get the views to display.

GenerateExam works now.. its not pretty, but it works.. Since then I have worked on Display Question, so that it now displays the answers that
the user chose in their most recent exam, and it also works without an exam context.

When I left, I was looking into the event system again. Its not clearing the current exam when you go to the index page for some reason.
