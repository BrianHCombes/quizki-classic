Simply described, Quizki is an application that allows you to test yourself. Consider the following scenario: You have just become interested in a topic you've never studied before. You read articles online, you read every book you can find, and you even look into what you'd need to know to get a certification. In other words, you're serious about learning this. Now, of course, as you're reading, you understand the new information presented to you. But, how can you be sure a week later, when you go to take the test, that you still comprehend what you read?

Enter Quizki.

Quizki is based around the concepts of questions, answers, and exams. You can enter questions and answers that describe the idea you are trying to remember. The point being, that if you can answer this question correctly, you can be sure you understand the concept at hand. These questions can be grouped together and presented to you in the form of an exam. Once you have answered the questions in an exam, Quizki can grade it, and tell you which you answered correctly, and which you missed. This way, you'll know which parts of those books you need to focus on.
