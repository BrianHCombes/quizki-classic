Installing Quizki on a completely new DigitalOcean droplet.

Assuming Ubuntu 14.04, and that you are initially logged in as 'root'.

0) 
> sudo visudo
at the bottom of the file, enter the line:
Defaults        env_keep += "PATH JAVA_HOME TOMCAT_HOME"

^X and save changes

1) Add the Quizki user - 
> sudo adduser quizki --gecos "First Last,RoomNumber,WorkPhone,HomePhone" --disabled-password && echo "quizki:password" | sudo chpasswd && sudo adduser quizki sudo

2) Login as the Quizki user

3) Get the quizki git repository
> cd ~ && mkdir apps && cd apps && sudo apt-get install -y git && git clone https://github.com/haxwell/quizki.git && cd quizki

4) Run the Quizki install script
> sudo ./install-droplet.sh

5) Reboot, and then run the post install scrip
> [reboot]
> cd ~/apps/quizki && ./install-droplet-post.sh




TODO NEXT: 
- Remove docs, examples, manager, and other directories from Tomcat installation.
- is email working? at present, its set up at zoho.com, but be sure you can send and receive email at jjames@quizki.com (or your own address if you're not me)

NOTES
======
0) env_keep, as explained in 'man sudoers': "Environment variables to be preserved in the user's environment when the env_reset option is in effect.  This allows fine-grained control over the environment sudo-spawned processes will receive." So when you use sudo as the quizki user, these variables will be available for use in the sudo environment.

1) This command adds a user named 'quizki' with a disabled password. The '--gecos' option is to prevent the command from requesting info interactively. Next, the password is set to 'password'. Finally the user is set to be allowed to use sudo.
